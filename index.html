            <p class="paraone font">I'm a 24-year-old man who loves computers, video games, history, and eSports. Most recently I have gotten into watching a few different kinds of eSports or "Electronic Sports." It's a fairly new interest of mine considering I never followed any kind of actual athletic sports but I never knew how invested I could become into something that seems so bizarre. It's gotten to the point where I'm looking to go to as many events and watch as many streams as I can fit into my schedule. That being said, I'm not much of a thrill seeker but when there is something that truly excites me, I don't think there is anything that will prevent me from satisfying that excitement.</p>

            <p class="paratwo font">Beyond gaming and eSports, I played some sports in elementary and middle school. When I was six years old to about 10 years old I played baseball on a local team! I didn't have a position since we were still basically learning the game to have fun, but I did hit a few good Home Runs! A few years later I delved into my first experience of Track and Field. I found out very quickly that I wasn't a runner or a jumper... However I did find that Shotput and Discus were right up my alley! Possible thanks to my experiencce in Baseball maybe? Who knows! I only did one season though as the next season ended abruptly thanks to a broken arm of mine...</p>
            
            <p class="parathree font">After I had finished baseball, I found myself less interested in sports and more interested in Music! I picked up the violin at 11-years-old and played all the way through my Senior year of High School! Through my time playing an insturment in a group setting, I learned a lot about confidence, cohesion, and cooperation. As tacky as that sounds, playing an instrument in front of a hundred or more people takes a lot of confidence. In order to be heard, you have to play as loud as the rest of the orchestra; and trust me, the audience can hear your mistakes. Every player is a cog in the machine of the music and the conductor is merely the driver behind the wheel. If the musicians are ill-prepared and ignorant to the piece they're playing, the entire ensemble can fall apart from one musician's lack of practice.</p>

            <p class="parafour font">In my time playing the violin I also learned a lot of history since so many pieces were written in different eras and played for certain events. Of course, the most famous orchestral ensembles are from Europe. Expanding beyond than just musical history, I'm a sucker for war history between WWI and WWII. However, I've never been outside of the country. I've always wanted to go somewhere where I can actually stand where a pivotal historical battle or opera took place. The more history I learn the more I want to go to those places to compare the photos, instruments, and vehicles and truly appreciate how far we, as a civilization, have come since both the beautiful and awful events took place.</p>
