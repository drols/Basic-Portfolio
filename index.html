    <p section="bodytext">I'm a 24-year-old man who loves computers, video games, technology, and eSports. I'm often looking at future technologies and gadgets to add to my collection of things I don't really need. Recently in the last couple years I have gotten into watching a few different kinds of eSports or "Electronic Sports." I'm not a thrill seeker but when there is something that truly excites me, I don't think there is anything that will prevent me from satisfying that excitement.</p>

    <p>Beyond gaming and technology I played some sports in elementary and middle school. When I was six years old to about 10 years old I played baseball on a local team! I didn't have a position since we were still basically learning the game to have fun.</p>
        
    <p>Eventually I found myself less interested in sports and more interested in Music! I picked up the violin at 11-years-old and played all the way through my Senior year of High School! Through my time playing an insturment in a group setting, I learned a lot about confidence, cohesion, and cooperation. As tacky as that sounds, playing an instrument in front of 100 or more people takes a lot of confidence. In order to be heard, you have to play as loud as the rest of the orchestra; and trust me. The audience can hear your mistakes. Every player is a cog in the machine of the music and the conductor is merely the driver behind the wheel. If the musicians are ill-prepared and ignorant to the piece they're playing, the entire ensemble can fall apart from one musician's lack of practice.</p>

    <p>I've never been outside of the country. I've always wanted to go somewhere where I can actually stand where a pivotal historical event took place. The more history I learn the more I want to go to those places to compare the photos and truly appreciate how far we, as a civilization, have come since those terrible events took place.</p>
